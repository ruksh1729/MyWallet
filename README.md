## Problem Statement

Modern blockchain applications require seamless wallet connectivity, but integrating different wallet providers into React applications remains fragmented and complex. Developers often struggle with inconsistent APIs, authentication flows, and cross-platform compatibility issues.

## Challenge

Create a browser extension wallet that:

1. Implements a standardized interface for connecting to any React application.
2. Supports multiple blockchain networks (e.g., Ethereum, Solana, or others of your choice).
3. Provides a simple, developer-friendly API for React applications to integrate with.
4. Handles secure key management and transaction signing.
5. Offers a clean user interface for wallet management and transaction approvals.

## Requirements

The wallet should:

- Work across major browsers.
- Require minimal configuration for integration into React applications.
- Implement security best practices.
- Support at least two blockchain networks.
- Demonstrate functionality with a simple React application.

## Installation & Execution

If you are downloading this project, follow these steps:

1. Install dependencies:
   sh
   npm install
   
2. Run the project:
   sh
   npm run dev
   

## Technologies Used

- React
- Blockchain libraries (specific to Ethereum, Solana)

## Future Enhancements

- Implement as a browser extension for seamless usage.
- Support additional blockchain networks.
- Enhance UI/UX for better user experience.
- Optimize security measures and key management.
